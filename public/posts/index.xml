      <description>I was recently reading about DCI Format 1-1 in TS 38.212 used in 5G-NR when I came across the frequency domain resource assignment. There were a couple of formulas that at first sight I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain, but upon reflecting on it, they have become clear.
Format 1-1 Format 1-1 is used in 5G-NR for scheduling PDSCH in one cell. Among other things, it includes the frequency domain assignment which is how the network tells the UE what frequency resources will be used for PDSCH.</description>
