In this post, I'll give an overview of the video game project I embarked some time
ago and that has taken much longer than originally intended :P .<br>
I'll probably make this into its own tab later since there are
lots to talk about in here!

## What is it?
The game is a 2D metroidvania.<br>
If you are unfamiliar with that word, a quick internet search will give an idea,
but the gist of it is that the game is non-linear in its world design.
The player is tasked with a goal and how he/she goes about reaching the destination is not entirely predetermined.<br>
Central to the metroidvania design is that there are "areas" which
are not accessible until the player finds/obtains the means to access them. Finding
them means exploring the world and keeping a mental map of where newly found items
could be used.

## Story
I cannot say much about story other than it is set in the distant future. <br>
The player controls the last human alive. Or so the story goes.<br>
A signal that looks distinctly human is received coming from an alien world.
What could it be?

## Gameplay
Being a 2D metroidvania, the player will traverse the world by controlling the
protagonist which is followd by a 2D side-scrolling camera.<br>
The protagonist enters an alien world with equipment that is unfit for the challenges ahead.<br>
The gameplay loop will consist of exploring the world, fighting enemies and discovering power-ups
that lets you fight harder enemies, access previously inaccessible areas, and
move the story forward.<br>
We have many interesting ideas down the pipe.
I really hope we get time to implement most of our ideas.

## Development
The game is developed using the Unity Engine (https://unity.com/). <br>
I have developed several "game systems" and custom inspector tools that helps us build the
world. My plan is to start a dev blog where I discuss some of these tools in more detail.

## Trailer
Enough talk, see the game in action in the following trailer.
